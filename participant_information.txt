    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>You are invited to take part in this research project, which is called <em>Rapid fact-checking of news</em>. This Participant Information Form tells you about the research project. It explains the processes involved with taking part. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part in the research.</p>
    <p>Please read this information carefully. Ask questions about anything that you don’t understand or want to know more about. Before deciding whether to take part, you might want to talk about it with a relative or friend.</p>
    <p>Participation in this research is voluntary. If you don’t wish to take part, you don’t have to.</p>
    <p>If you decide you want to take part in the research project, you may continue onwards to the task after reading this Participant Information sheet.</p>
    <p>By completing the task you are telling us that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand what you have read</li>
      <li>Consent to take part in the research project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may download a copy of this to keep.</p>

    <h2>2. What is the purpose of this research?</h2>
    <p>In today’s news-media landscape, people are exposed to an ever-increasing volume of content within very short timeframes. This rapid influx of information on social media means that individuals often encounter political claims and news updates almost instantaneously. In such an environment, it is crucial for news consumers to quickly assess the reliability of statements to prevent the formation of beliefs based on misinformation.</p>
    <p>The aim of the study is to investigate the speed and efficiency at which people evaluate political claims. This research has been initiated by Dr&nbsp;Lauren&nbsp;Saling, Dr&nbsp;Damiano&nbsp;Spina and PhD Candidate Fletcher&nbsp;Scott, and the results will be used by Fletcher&nbsp;Scott to obtain a PhD in Psychology.</p>
    <p>This research is funded by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.</p>

    <h2>3. What does participation in this research involve?</h2>
    <p>If you decide to take part in the research project, you will first complete a short screening questionnaire (about one minute) to determine your eligibility. If you meet the requirements and choose to continue, you will see 40 statements—some true, some false.</p>
    <p>You will then complete a reaction-time task: for each statement you have up to 10&nbsp;seconds to decide if you believe it is true or false (press “1” for True and “0” for False). Please respond as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>After this task you will answer a brief questionnaire about your perception of each statement, followed by some non-identifying demographic questions.</p>
    <p>The entire study is expected to last about 15&nbsp;minutes. There are no costs associated with participating, and you will receive <strong>$7&nbsp;AUD</strong> for your time. If the screening questionnaire shows you do not meet the requirements, you will not be able to participate.</p>

    <h2>4. Other relevant information about the research project</h2>
    <p>Approximately 75 participants will take part in the study.</p>

    <h2>5. Do I have to take part in this research project?</h2>
    <p>Participation in any research project is voluntary. If you do not wish to take part, you do not have to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw from the project at any stage.</p>
    <p>If you do decide to take part, you will be given this Participant Information Form to keep.</p>
    <p>Your decision whether to take part, not to take part, or to withdraw will not affect your relationship with the researchers or with RMIT University.</p>
    <p>Submitting your completed questionnaire is an indication of your consent to participate in the study. You can withdraw your responses any time before you have submitted the questionnaire. Once submitted, your responses cannot be withdrawn because they are non-identifiable.</p>

    <h2>6. What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>
    <p>We cannot guarantee or promise that you will receive any direct benefits; however, you may value contributing to knowledge and gaining insights about world events and current news. The community may also benefit, as your data can inform interventions that help users critically engage with news content.</p>

    <h2>7. What are the risks and disadvantages of taking part?</h2>
    <h3>Psychological distress</h3>
    <p>You may find some questions stressful or upsetting. If you do not wish to answer a question, you may stop immediately. If you become distressed, please contact your GP or use these country-specific mental-health resources: <a href="https://letstalkaboutmentalhealth.com.au/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Talk About Mental Health</a>.</p>
    <h3>Privacy concerns</h3>
    <p>This project uses <em>Qualtrics</em> to collect survey data. Responses are stored on their servers; no personal information is collected. After data collection and analysis, data will be moved to an RMIT server and stored securely for five years, after which the Qualtrics data will be deleted.</p>

    <h2>8. What if I withdraw from this research project?</h2>
    <p>You may withdraw at any time before submitting your responses. Because all data are anonymous, submitted responses cannot be withdrawn.</p>

    <h2>9. What happens when the research project ends?</h2>
    <p>If you would like a summary of the results, please email Fletcher&nbsp;Scott (<a href="mailto:s3954401@student.rmit.edu.au">s3954401@student.rmit.edu.au</a>) or Dr&nbsp;Lauren&nbsp;Saling (<a href="mailto:lauren.saling@rmit.edu.au">lauren.saling@rmit.edu.au</a>) after December&nbsp;2025.</p>

    <h2>10. What will happen to information about me?</h2>
    <p>By continuing to the survey, you consent to the research team collecting and using your information for the research project. Any identifiable information will remain confidential; in fact, no personal data will be collected.</p>
    <p>Results will be published and/or presented in forums where you cannot be identified. Anonymous data may be stored indefinitely in a repository so that other researchers can verify findings. Anonymised data from your choices will form part of a published dataset—for example, enabling studies on whether true news is recognised more quickly when it is left-wing versus right-wing.</p>

    <h2>11. Who is organising and funding the research?</h2>
    <p>This research is conducted by Dr&nbsp;Lauren&nbsp;Saling, Dr&nbsp;Damiano&nbsp;Spina and Fletcher&nbsp;Scott. It is funded by the RMIT HDR student fund.</p>

    <h2>12. Who has reviewed the research project?</h2>
    <p>All human-research projects in Australia are reviewed by an independent ethics-review body. This project has been approved by an RMIT University review body and will be carried out according to the <em>National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research&nbsp;(2023)</em>.</p>
