    <h2>1. Thank you for participating</h2>
    <p>The research team sincerely thanks you for taking part in this project.</p>

    <h2>2. What was this study about?</h2>
    <p>You were asked to decide whether a series of news headlines were true or false. The purpose of the research is to examine how <em>clickbait</em> wording might influence the way people judge the truth of information. Emotional cues embedded in sensational headlines can make us more likely to accept and share content that aligns with our existing views, even when it is inaccurate. By investigating the shortcuts people use when encountering sensational headlines, this project aims to understand why such content can contribute to biased information consumption and political polarisation.</p>

    <h2>3. Your experimental condition</h2>
    <p>You were in the <strong>clickbait group</strong>. Each headline you saw was phrased in a sensational, curiosity-inducing style (e.g.&nbsp;dramatic wording) while the underlying factual claim remained unchanged. This allows us to test whether emotionally provocative language affects the speed or confidence with which people judge a headline’s truth.</p>

    <h2>4. Fact-checking sheet</h2>
    <p>It is important that you do not leave the study believing any false statements. To address this, we are providing a fact-checking sheet that lists the correct factual status of every headline you saw. Please review it to clarify any misconceptions that may have arisen during the task.</p>
